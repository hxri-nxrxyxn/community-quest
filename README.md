# CommunityQuest

CommunityQuest is a gamified, real-world mapping platform that promotes community service by connecting volunteers with local causes in need of support. This innovative app bridges the gap between eager volunteers and communities in need, making it easy to find, join, and contribute to impactful social initiatives. Volunteers can sign up for tasks, track their contributions, and earn rewards for their involvement, creating a fun and rewarding experience while fostering positive change.
